My purpose in making this project is to use the power of React Hooks on the page by using multiple methods. I imported the images in the Asset folder directly to the page and replaced the images on the pages that could not be found. With Firebase Authentication, I restricted access to the page without user login. With the useContext structure, it was possible to access the firebase functions from each component and I provided the page transitions with the routers. I have completely fulfilled the Single page Application features. I used Bootstrap for sytlingI tried to pay attention to every detail to make the page responsive.
